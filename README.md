# Count Your Days

A simple iOS countdown app built in Swift using UIKit and Xcode. This project was created to explore view layout, user input handling, and basic persistent storage in a lightweight iOS interface.

## Features

- Add and name custom countdown events
- Track days remaining until important (or ominous) dates
- Minimalist design focused on clarity and ease of use

## Why "Count Your Days"?

The name adds a little dark humor to an otherwise cheerful countdown app ‚Äî because deadlines are deadlines, whether it's vacation or launch day.

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- UIKit
- AutoLayout
- Xcode

## Status

üõ†Ô∏è Still being refined as I explore more advanced Swift features (animations, local notifications, SwiftUI migration).
